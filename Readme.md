# SUTDopoly!

**SUTDopoly** is a text-based boardgame that is run straight from the command line. As the name may suggest, it is a board game heavily inspired by the classic game: Monopoly.



As a variation of Monopoly, SUTDopoly follows similar rules, but is instead structured around the setting of SUTD whereby the properties names are the names of Fifth Rows and the Chance and Chest cards are relatable to SUTD students. However, several features, like auctions, railroads, and jail, were not implemented into the final design of SUTDopoly.



This version of SUTDopoly plays wholely on the CLI, and supports various features such as:
 - Most important features of the Monopoly game!
 - Animated board movement!
 - Play offline with multiple users on a single computer, or
 - Choose to play online across CLIs and computers! 

** Do note that the current iteration of the application does NOT support online play, as the firebase realtime DB instance has been taken down.
